  <section id="about">
    <p>
      I’m a data and systems developer with a focus on automation, analytics, and applied cybersecurity. I build tools and workflows that make systems smarter, safer, and more reliable.
    </p>
    <p>
      My recent work includes developing end-to-end automated reporting solutions for millions of transactions at Capitec Bank, as well as building internal tools for cybersecurity analysis, metadata extraction, and cloud-integrated validation.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m currently upskilling in artificial intelligence, Red Team practices, and AWS cloud architecture. Across every project, I bring a mindset rooted in problem-solving, data integrity, and secure design — aimed at strengthening the systems people depend on every day.
