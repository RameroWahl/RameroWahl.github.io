    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I’ve always been drawn to the places where systems break. Not for the chaos—but for what lies underneath. The patterns nobody saw, the logic barely holding the structure together, the quiet places where everything could fail… or be rebuilt.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      I don’t just work with data or code—I chase what’s hidden. Vulnerabilities. Blind spots. The kind of things that stay invisible until someone like me finds them. It’s not about being reckless. It’s about being precise, deliberate, and knowing exactly where to pull when the time comes.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Tools don’t define me, but I build them. Systems don’t intimidate me—I map them. Somewhere between digital forensics, cybersecurity, and offensive research, I found where I belong: working in the dark, building what others won’t, and going where most people can’t.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      If you’re reading this, you’re already closer to the edge than you think.
